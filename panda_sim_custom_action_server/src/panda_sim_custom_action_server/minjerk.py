~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ Min Jerk ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
A library for computing minimum jerk trajectory for an arbitrary
set of control points in R2, R3, up to RN space.

  x(t) = a0 + a1*t + a2*t^2 + a3*t^3 + a4*t^4 + a5*t^5
 x'(t) = a1 + 2*a2*t + 3*a3*t^2 + 4*a4*t^3 + 5*a5*t^4
x''(t) = 2*a2 + 6*a3*t + 12*a4*t^2 + 20*a5*t^3

Solve this problem from boundary conditions of x(0), x'(0), x''(0) and
x(T), x'(T), x''(T).

ex. usage:

import numpy
import minjerk
points_array = numpy.array([[1, 2, 3], [4, 4, 4],
                            [6, 4, 6], [2, 5, 6],
                            [5, 6, 7]])
m_coeffs = minjerk.minjerk_coefficients(points_array)
m_curve = minjerk.minjerk_trajectory(m_coeffs, 10)
