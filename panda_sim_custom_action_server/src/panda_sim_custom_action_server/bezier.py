The Bezier library was  implemented as a class project in CIS515,
Fundamentals of Linear Algebra, taught by Professor Jean Gallier
in the summer of 2011 at the University of Pennsylvania. For an
excellent explanation of Cubic Bezier Curves, and the math
represented in this library, see
http://www.cis.upenn.edu/~cis515/proj1-12.pdf

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ Bezier ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
A library for computing Bezier Cubic Splines for an arbitrary
set of control points in R2, R3, up to RN space.

Cubic Segment:
C(t) = (1 - t)^3*b0 + 3(1 - t)*b1 + 3(1 - t)*t^2*b2 + t^3*b3

Bezier Spline of Cubic Segments:
B(t) = C_(i)(t-i+1), i-1 <= t <= i
where C0 continuity exists: C_(i)(1) = C_(i+1)(0)
where C1 continuity exists: C'_(i)(1) = C'_(i+1)(0)
and where C2 continuity exists: C"_(i)(1) = C"_(i+1)(0)

ex. usage:
import numpy
import bezier
points_array = numpy.array([[1, 2, 3], [4, 4, 4],
                            [6, 4, 6], [2, 5, 6],
                            [5, 6, 7]])
d_pts = bezier.de_boor_control_pts(points_array)
b_coeffs = bezier.bezier_coefficients(points_array, d_pts)
b_curve = bezier.bezier_curve(b_coeffs, 50)
